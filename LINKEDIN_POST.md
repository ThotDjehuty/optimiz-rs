🚀 OptimizR v1.0.0 is LIVE! 🚀

I'm thrilled to announce the first stable release of OptimizR - a high-performance Rust library for optimization and statistical inference! 🎉

📦 What is OptimizR?

OptimizR brings blazing-fast implementations of advanced algorithms to data science:
• Differential Evolution (5 strategies with adaptive jDE)
• Hidden Markov Models (Baum-Welch, Viterbi)
• MCMC Sampling (Metropolis-Hastings)
• Mean Field Games (PDE solvers)
• Information Theory tools

⚡ The Performance Story:
• 50-100× faster than pure Python
• 95% memory reduction vs NumPy/SciPy
• Production-ready with comprehensive testing

🔥 Real-World Benchmarks:
• HMM Training: 0.03s (Rust) vs 2.4s (Python) = 80× speedup
• Differential Evolution: 0.12s (Rust) vs 8.9s (SciPy) = 74× speedup
• Mean Field Games: 0.4s (Rust) vs 45s (Python) = 112× speedup
