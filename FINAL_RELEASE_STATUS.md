### Package Details
- **Name:** `optimiz-rs` ✨ (shorter, cleaner than optimizr-rs!)
- **Published:** February 17, 2026
- **Live at:** https://pypi.org/project/optimiz-rs/1.0.0/
- **Install:** `pip install optimiz-rs`

### Why "optimiz-rs"?
PyPI package names are case-insensitive and normalize punctuation:
- ❌ `optimizR` → normalizes to `optimizr` (conflicts with v1.4.7)
- ❌ `optimiz-r` → normalizes to `optimizr` (conflicts)
- ✅ `optimiz-rs` → unique, professional, clear Rust variant

---

## 🎊 PUBLICATION COMPLETE!

Both crates.io and PyPI are now live and fully functional!

**Verification:**
- ✅ Rust: `cargo add optimizr` → https://crates.io/crates/optimizr
- ✅ Python: `pip install optimiz-rs` → https://pypi.org/project/optimiz-rs/
